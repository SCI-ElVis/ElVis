Build Zlib
http://www.zlib.net/
Zlib is required for the png library, which is used for screenshots.
Unpack the zip file, and use cmake to configure.  Set the install prefix to an appropriate location for your system.  Note that the zlib packaged with ElVis has a slightly modified CMakeLists.txt to fix a compile error.  If you download a version manually, you will need to make similar modifications.

Build libPNG.
http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
Unpack and run cmake.
Set ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR to the include directory from the previous step.
Set ZLIB_LIBRARY to /lib/zlib.lib
Set install dir to a reasonable value.
