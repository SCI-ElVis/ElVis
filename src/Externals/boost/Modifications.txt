Modifications:

To allow for this boost package to be a sub project, a few minor modifications were made:

(1) Only boost/boost and boost/libs are included.

(2) All documentation / Test code was removed from boost/libs.

(3) The file boost/config/autolink.hpp was modified to disable autolink, to ensure the library is build the same way on every platform.

(4) A master CMakeLists.txt file was added to compile the majority of the libraries.

(5)python/converter/builtin_converters.hpp modified to work properly with Python3.

(6) Added process from unapproved projects

(7) Fixed compiler warnings
